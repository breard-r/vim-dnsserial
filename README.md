vim-dnsserial
=============

Another DNS-zone serial number updater.


Why?
----

I know this not the first vim plugin available to update a DNS-zone serial number. Here is a few reasons why I chose not to use the canonical one:

* there is no license and therefore it is not free;
* it is unmaintained;
* it is bugged;
* it lacks functionalities.

It chose not to fork the original plugin but to write a new one from scratch mainly for legal purposes, but also because I did not found the code as simple as I expected.
